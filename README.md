# ThreeDeconv.jl

**ThreeDeconv.jl** is a 3D deconvolution software for fluorescence microscopy written in [Julia](https://julialang.org). Currently, it supports Julia v.1.6.0 but may not be going to be supported in the future releases.
If interested, please feel free to make a PR.
The detail of the algorithm is available in [our paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-29768-x) and [our website](http://www.computationalimaging.org/publications/2d-deconvolution-for-low-photon-count-fluorescence-imaging-scientific-reports-2019/).
While the deconvolution algorithm is the same as described in the paper, we made some improvements in our software along with the major update of Julia and related packages. Thanks to this update, this package is significantly faster than the speed reported on the paper and deconvoles a 256 x 256 x 57 image in 5 seconds!  Please refer to [NEWS.md](NEWS.md) to catch up the updates.

# Installation
Hit the key `]` in the Julia REPL to ender the Pkg REPL-mode, and run

```julia-repl
pkg> add https://github.com/computational-imaging/ThreeDeconv.jl.git
```

# Example usage
To run the example script, you need [`PyCall.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl) and [`Conda.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaPy/Conda.jl). In addition, you need [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) available through `PyCall`. You can run the following in Julia's REPL to install them.
```julia-repl
julia> import Pkg; Pkg.add("Conda")
julia> import Conda; Conda.add_channel("conda-forge"); Conda.update(); Conda.add("scikit-image")
julia> ENV["PYTHON"] = joinpath(Conda.PYTHONDIR, "python")
julia> Pkg.add("PyCall")
```
If you already have a Python environment that you want to use from Julia, please consult with `PyCall.jl`.
Since these packages are required just for image I/O, you can also use other packages if you want.
However, I personally found that `scikit-image` is the most convenient package to read multi-stack tiff files from Julia.

If you have a CUDA-compatible NVIDIA GPU, the example script runs on a GPU. You might want to use [`PackageCompiler.jl'](https://julialang.github.io/PackageCompiler.jl/dev/examples/plots/) to create a sysimage.

Then, after downloading the dataset (described below) in the `example` directory, run
```
julia example.jl
```
from your terminal in the `example` directory. The script simulates the PSF, deconvolves the fluorescent bead and saves the deconvolved image.

# Dataset
The dataset used in our paper is available at [Google Drive (150MB)](https://drive.google.com/a/stanford.edu/file/d/1lWlvngb5iJkToFKLSA3N1FuScVPTe-42/view?usp=sharing).
The images are processed with darkfield and flatfield correction as described in the paper. Its raw dataset is also available at [Google Drive (1GB)](https://drive.google.com/a/stanford.edu/file/d/1pg_OG5GxjcKMSvwi4Si0HTyWT0XCW4Kt/view?usp=sharing).
This dataset comes with corresponding darkfield and flatfield images.

This dataset can be used for academic and other non-commercial purposes.
If you use this dataset in your research paper, please cite our paper.

# Disclaimer
[The Jupyter notebook](example/Example.ipynb) is not maintained anymore. But you may be able to easilly modify it to make it runnable by referring to [example.jl](example/example.jl)

# To biologists

If you find this package useful but feel that it lacks some functionalities for your research, feel free to create an issue in this repository or send an email [@hayatoikoma](https://github.com/hayatoikoma). I am happy to extend this package to accomodate your need.

# Developers
This package is mostly developed by [@hayatoikoma](https://github.com/hayatoikoma), and the PSF simulator (WaveOptics.jl) is developed by [@broxtronix](https://github.com/broxtronix).
`WaveOptics.jl` is still an unreleased Julia package for various PSF simulations.
`ThreeDeconv.jl` has incorporated part of `WaveOptics.jl` for this release.
