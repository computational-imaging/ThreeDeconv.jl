Generic Optical Recipe for Widefield PSF Models

**Parameters**

    objective_mag - magnification of the objective
    objective_na - numerical aperture of the objective
    wavelength - emission wavelength of the light being imaged (all simulations are monochromatic)
    medium_index - index of refraction of the sample medium
    f_tubelens - tube lens focal length (e.g. 200mm for Nikon, 180mm for Olympus, etc.)
    static_aperture_mask - Supply a back aperture mask that is a subclass of CodedAperture, or
               'NullCodedAperture()' if there is no aperture code.  The static mask is computed
               when the PSF model is constructed, and is therefore more efficient than the
               dynamic_aperture_mask.
    dynamic_aperture_mask - Supply a back aperture mask that is a subclass of CodedAperture, or
               'NullCodedAperture()' if there is no aperture code.  The dynamic_aperture_mask
               is recomputed each time apsf() is called, but this flexibility incurs additional
               performance overhead.
    normalize_intensity - Set max PSF value @ z = 0 to 1.0.  This is an arbitrary choice, but
               one that keeps PSF values relatively well scaled and makes it easy to adjust the
               "exposure" of the simulated microscope by multipyling the PSF to get some number of
               photons that is >= 1.  However, be careful when mixing optical models with different
               recipes, because their absolute intensities cannot be directly compared with this
               arbitrary scaling in effect.
