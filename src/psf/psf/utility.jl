"""
In order to avoid aliasing artifacts, the wave optics simulation must be
carried out at a resolution close to the diffraction limit. However, image
sensors sometimes undersample as compared to this limit, thus we may need to
downsample here to reach the resolution of the image sensor.

This utility function performs a downsampling by averaging together oversampling
x oversampling square blocks of pixels. This actually produces some aliasing,
but this aliasing should be present in the real optical system as well.

TODO: someday we could add pixel fill factor as a parameter to this function.
