# Base Type
#
# All PointSpreadFunctionModel subtypes will inherit from this base type.
abstract type PointSpreadFunctionModel end

# be computed using a convolution with a PSF for that z-plane.
#
# Examples: DebyeModel(), VectorialDebyeModel(), and DefocusModel().
#
abstract type LateralShiftInvariantModel <: PointSpreadFunctionModel end

# In a periodic shift invariant models, the point spread function
# displays some periodic lateral shift invariance, but is not completey
# shift invariant.  Projection operators for such models can still be
# computed fairly efficiently using a sequence of convolution operations.
#
# Subtypes of this type must define 'shift_invariance_subpixels' and
# 'shift_invariance_dimensions' to indicate the periodicity of that
# particular model.
#
# Examples: LightFieldModel()
#
abstract type PeriodicShiftInvariantModel <: PointSpreadFunctionModel end

# Shift variant models cannot be projected using convolution, since
# they allow for PSFs that change with every 3D point location.

# Examples: CodedApertureLightFieldModel()

This function takes an APSF lookup up table computed using apsf_scalar_debye

APSF to interpolate and place it at any location x, y at the depth z for

Note, the translation could have been accomplished with a tilt in the back
aperture plane via translation_mask(), but this would have potentially led
to sampling problems if a large tilt (due to a large x or y translation)
exceeded the nyquist sampling rate of the back aperture. For general
translations which may be large, this method is more robust.
