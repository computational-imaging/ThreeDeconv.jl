"""
Returns a 2D grid of spatial frequencies (in both cartesian and polar
coordinates). Frequencies are normalized such that `R == 1` is along the edge
of the aperture defined by `objective_na / wavelength`.

Many functions will repeatedly re-use the coordinates produced by
fourier_plane_meshgrid(), so we will momoize the results so that they are
cached if the arguments to the function remain the same again and again.

**Parameters**

`sim_size_px` - the size of the simulation in the object (or image) plane

`sample_period` - the period (i.e. sample spacing) in the object (or image) plane

`objective_na, wavelength` - numerical aperture and emission wavelength

`focal_length` - focal length of the objective (or tubelens).  Used when units = "meters"

`units` - string
    one of : `[ "spatial_freq", "m", "normalized" ]`

* `"spatial_freq"` - return back aperture coordinates in terms of the spatial frequency of waves in the object plane.
* `"meters"` - returns back aperture coordinates in terms of their real
* `"normalized"` - returns back aperture coordinates in a normalized coordinate space where the aperture lies on the unit disc, |r| <= 1.

`coordinate_system` - string
    one of : `[ "cartesian", "polar", "both" ]`

**Returns**

`(fx, fy)` when `coordinate_system == "cartesian"` or `(r, theta)` when `coordinate_system == "polar"`
